After neglecting my site for a long time I decided to finally start tinkering with it again. My first version of the site was build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), specifically [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). Since a Jekyll-Bootstrap project can be hosted and maintained on GitHub, I thought it would be the most straightforward approach to build my site. I've had no issues for the year or so I used it. It was simple to modify, update and deploy. Additionally, there was an active Jekyll community on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll) which I often referred to when I ran into problems. Now, all that being said, I think it's time to move on. One of the biggest reasons I decided to move on to [DocPad](http://docpad.org) was because it gave the all the functionality I had with Jekyll but also provided a great [plugin](http://docpad.org/docs/plugins) system which allows me to extend the functionality of my site. Another big reason I decided to try out DocPad was because it is built with Node.js instead of a Ruby-based project like Jekyll. What this means is I can use npm, which I already used, to install plugins or new features. For example if I want to install livereload, all I'd have to do is run 'docpad install livereload' which is basically the same thing as 'npm install docpad-plugin-livereload.' How easy is that?! I'm very pleased with the product so far. Keep a lookout as I'll continue to work on improving and updating my site in the coming months.
